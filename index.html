      <h1>Paper Computers</h1>
<p class="subtitle"></p>

<p>Tabletop games are “paper computers,” says Matthew Kirschenbaum (<a href="http://www.academia.edu/16198903/War_Stories_Board_Wargames_and_Vast_Procedural_Narratives">2009</a>). Their histories are centuries old.<label for="ur" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ur" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/508v4/assets/img/ur.jpg" /><br />1.

<p>This seminar follows that low-tech disposition. We’ll survey the pasts of paper computers and their entanglements with literature. We’ll visit Special Collections to study some pertinent media, such as artists’ books, moveable books, machine-woven books, miniatures, cards, boards, and zines. Then you’ll select an “-ism” (e.g., imagism, constructivism, or thingism) and use it to prototype a tabletop game. We’ll discuss the dynamics that bridge aesthetics with mechanics, including how games rehearse legacies of colonialism and capital accumulation. What alternatives exist, and how are they made?</p>

<p>We’ll play some games as we go, and read a smidgen of fiction and history, too.<label for="canestraro" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="canestraro" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/508v4/assets/img/canestraro.jpg" /><br />3.

<h2 id="aims-">Aims <a href="#aims-">#</a></h2>

<p>By the end of this seminar, I’m hoping you will:</p>

<p>~ Examine the entanglements of game studies with literary and media studies through A-D-M and M-D-A frameworks (see <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/hunickeMDA.pdf">Hunicke, LeBlanc, and Zubek</a>) that foreground the dynamics (“D”) between aesthetics (“A”) and mechanics (“M”).<br />
~ Understand paper computing as a centuries-old design practice and approach it through low-tech methods anchored in prototyping and playtesting. <br />
~ Learn how speculation and prototyping apply to humanities project design and development, with particular attention to procedural literacy and material culture as well as paradigms of labour, conjecture, and negotiation.  <br />
~ Prototype an offline tabletop game (e.g., board game, card game, or tile game) informed by the politics and aesthetics of an “-ism” (between 1870 and 1970).<label for="surrealism" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="surrealism" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/508v4/assets/img/surrealism.jpg" /><br />7. A Surrealist game. Cards from <em>Le Jeu de Marseille</em> published by Grimaud (Paris, 1983). The designs were first published in <em>VVV Magazine</em> (New York, 1943). Images courtesy of <a href="http://www.wopc.co.uk/france/grimaud/le-jeu-de-marseille">Barney Townshend</a>. Used with permission.</span><br />
~ Document your prototyping process through a combination of text and (moving) images. <br />
~ Share and test your tabletop game with people in and beyond this seminar, while playing a few games, too.  <br />
~ Communicate (via a presentation and in writing) the relevance of your game prototype to literary and media studies.</p>

<p>Please note that this seminar does not require or involve any computer programming. It does not assume that you are a “gamer” or “geek,” care about being a gamer or geek, or have any experience with tabletop gaming, prototyping, or media studies. It is not a course intended to prepare you specifically for careers in the game or design industries (even if it will inevitably overlap with those industries). It is instead a course about using design methods to conjecture about the past and prompt meaningful interactions in the present.</p>

<p>Technical expertise required: know how to send an email.</p>

<h2 id="materials-">Materials <a href="#materials-">#</a></h2>

<p>There is no textbook for this seminar, but I produced a passcode-protected <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/">course reader</a> (in PDF) for you. See me for the ID and passcode. Links to individual readings are provided in the <a href="#schedule">schedule</a>. Beyond those, I recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/"><em>Tabletop Simulator</em></a> (Berserk Games); <a href="https://www.romerogames.ie/shop/challenges-for-game-designers-by-brenda-romero-ian-schreiber"><em>Challenges for Game Designers</em></a>, by Brenda Romero and Ian Schreiber; and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.schellgames.deckoflenses&amp;hl=en"><em>A Deck of Lenses</em></a> (app), by Jesse Schell. You’ll need access to a computer, and you might find a camera (or mobile phone) to be useful for documentation and prototyping.</p>

<p>I encourage you to compile (in groups or individually) your own “bit boxes” for prototyping.<label for="gloomhaven" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="gloomhaven" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/508v4/assets/img/gloomhaven.jpg" /><br />8.

You may also need a few dollars to cover printing and fabricating costs.</p>

<p>Where possible, I will provide you with access to tabletop games.<label for="classstruggle" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="classstruggle" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/508v4/assets/img/struggle.jpg" /><br />9.

Each week I will mention some games (and perhaps recommend one or two), but I won’t require you to play many in particular.</p>

<p>We may be able to use facilities on campus to design and fabricate components for your prototypes. These facilities contain 3D printers, routers, and laser cutters, but some of the equipment may only be used with permission or is subject to restricted use (because safety).<label for="landlord" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="landlord" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/508v4/assets/img/landlord.jpg" /><br />10.

<h2 id="work-">Work <a href="#work-">#</a></h2>

<p>This seminar is project-based, meaning you’ll focus on the design and development of a prototype throughout the term (especially the second half), while also attending to matters of history, aesthetics, and culture. I’m asking you to cook up the following in the process:</p>

<p>~ Design Document (20% x 2): documentation of the iterative design and development of your game, including game components and drafts as well as responses to readings, games, playtests, and guest talks. You’ll submit the design doc twice (middle and end of term), and I’ll mark it each time.     <br />
~ Prototype (25%): not polished, but a playable, offline tabletop game complete with a manual and components (such as a board, tiles, and cards) enacting the game’s theme, mechanics, inventory, and rules while also asking “what if?” of literary and media history.    <br />
~ Talk + Paper (20%): a five- to seven-minute talk (delivered at the end of term) and revised into a final paper. It should address the relevance of your prototype to literary and media studies.<br />
~ Participation (15%): such as preparing for seminar, bringing prototypes to meetings, contributing to discussions, and participating in workshops and playtests.</p>

<p>I’ll nudge you to avoid prototyping the following categories of games (during seminar I’ll explain why): trivia, quiz/word, old school revival, roll-and-move, tactical war, sequel, expansion, and educational. I can of course be convinced to rethink these biases. You may also decide to prototype a historical game (associated with a specific -ism) that either no longer exists or is difficult to access. For examples of this sort of work, see prototypes by <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/konkolLoy.pdf">Margaret Konkol</a> and <a href="http://pwp.gatech.edu/suffragetto/">Renee M. Shelby</a>.</p>

<h2 id="schedule-">Schedule <a href="#schedule-">#</a></h2>

<p>Here’s the weekly schedule, which is subject to change. If I change it, then I’ll notify you at least one week in advance during seminar and/or via email.</p>

<p>I always over-plan. I will inevitably cut material, including workshops, readings, and exercises, especially when you and/or I feel like it’s just too much. Please note that guest speakers will contribute frequently to the seminar.<label for="speakers" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="speakers" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Guest speakers this term</strong>: Avery Alder, Nina Belojevic, Whitney ‘Strix’ Beltrán, Anne Burdick, Emily Care Boss, Alexander Galloway, Amy Hildreth Chen, Isaac Childres, Derek Hansen, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Kari Kraus, Michael Lines, Shaun Macpherson, Renee M. Shelby, Nikki Valens, and Lara Wilson<br /><br /><strong>Readings this term</strong>: work by Meguey Baker, Whitney ‘Strix’ Beltrán, Elizabeth W.

Delany, Johanna Drucker, Mary Flanagan, Alexander Galloway, Lisa Gitelman, Jessica Hammer, Katherine Hayles, Laura Heffernan, Margaret Konkol, Louise Krasniewicz, Kari Kraus, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Elizabeth LaPensée, Jerome McGann, Michelle Lorna Nahanee, Bethany Nowviskie, Janice Radway, Patrick Rael, Lisa Samuels, Susan Stewart, Melissa Terras, and some primary sources of your choice </span> I will ask you to respond briefly (via your design doc) to our conversations with these speakers. Their names and affiliations are listed in the margins of this site (desktop view) or via plus buttons (mobile view), together with keywords and methods for each week. Please don’t worry if the keywords, methods, or names are unfamiliar to you. We’ll cover them during seminar and, more important, put them into conversation with the praxis of prototyping.</p>

<p>Also note that reading is front-loaded in this course. You’ll read more during the first half of term, and you’ll turn your attention to prototyping during the second half. Throughout the term, I hope you have multiple opportunities to play some games, too.<label for="gamestoplay" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="gamestoplay" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Games this term</strong>: We’ll study <em>Mark</em>, <em>Codex Conquest</em>, <em>Gloomhaven</em>, <em>The Tessera Inventors</em>, <em>The Quiet Year</em>, and <em>Mansions of Madness</em> during seminar. You’ll also pick a few games to play on your own. Throughout the schedule, I’ve listed many (probably too many) games for your consideration. Search this page for ‘Optional’ to find them. These aren’t recommendations, tho. Mileage may vary. Drop a line with any questions or concerns. </span> If you have questions, concerns, or doubts about any game I’ve listed here, then don’t hesitate to ask me for details before playing it. Finally, I link to many things here. Please don’t feel like you have to follow those links, let alone read what’s referenced. I provide the links for the purposes of attribution and scholarly responsibility and also in case you wish to pursue particular topics down the line.</p>

<p>“Paper computing” and “speculative design” are not exactly common terms in English departments. This week we’ll spend some time defining and contextualizing them, considering their relevance to literary and media studies, and discussing how they will “unfold” in this seminar. (Sorry. I can’t resist puns.) I’ll also help you to plan ahead for the term.<label for="week1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="week1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Keywords and methods for Week 1</strong>: A-D-M, aleatory procedures, conjectural criticism, design as inquiry, forensic imagination, game states, M-D-A, near futures, participatory or generative research, prediction, restoration, scenario or experience prototyping, simulation exercises, speculative design, speculative fiction, subjunctive knowledge, Wizard of Oz<br /><br /><strong>Guest speakers for Week 1</strong>: <a href="https://ninabelojevic.wordpress.com/">Nina Belojevic</a> and <a href="https://www.shaunmacpherson.com/">Shaun Macpherson</a> (both UVic English grads) on prototyping as academic and industry work </span></p>

<p>Paper computing (see <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/kirschenbaumWar.pdf">Kirschenbaum</a>) and paper prototyping are relevant to present-day project design and development because they provide us with a sense of history while bypassing widespread tendencies to focus on whiz-bang technologies, which may demand significant resources that are not exactly accessible.<label for="prototypes" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="prototypes" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Some ways to prototype historical texts</strong>: imitation (labour of the text), forgery (economy of the text), scenario (interaction through the text), story (performance of the text), counterfactual (norms of the text), model (logic of the text), glitch (negotiations with the text), and wish (ideology of the text). I’ll elaborate during seminar. </span> They are conducive to various humanities methods (e.g., remediation and versioning), too, and they stress how people interact with materials. Speculative design (see <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/speculative-everything">Dunne and Raby</a> and <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/lukensDisalvoDesign.pdf">Lukens and DiSalvo</a>) is useful since it puts design first, rather than treating it as the last step (“polishing” or “finishing”) of a project. It also privileges conjecture over proof while corresponding meaningfully with studies of speculative fiction, science fiction, fantasy, and futurisms, such as Afrofuturisms (see <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/nelsonFuture.pdf">Nelson</a>), Indigenous Futurisms (see <a href="https://uapress.arizona.edu/book/walking-the-clouds">Dillon</a>), and near futures (see <a href="http://nearfuturelaboratory.com/">Bleecker et al.</a>).

<p>While histories of paper computing could focus mostly, if not entirely, on tabletop gaming, this week we’ll suspend game studies and attend to other media histories where paper and computing meet. How are marks on paper not just authored or read, but used? How does paper serve as a storage medium for computation? Or as a mechanism for compiling and re-membering this into that? Who has been called a computer, and what roles did paper play in their labour and occupations? <label for="week2" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="week2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Keywords and methods for Week 2</strong>: affect, algorithm, blanks, context of use, machines, memory, ontological theatre, media archaeology, procedural experimentation, storage<br /><br /><strong>Guest speakers for Week 2</strong>: <a href="http://amyhildrethchen.com/">Amy Hildreth Chen</a> (Special Collections Instruction Librarian, University of Iowa) on <a href="https://humangames.lab.uiowa.edu/">Human(ities) Games</a>, and also <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/library/research/librarians/ljwilson/index.php">Lara Wilson</a> (Director of Special Collections and University Archivist at UVic; Chair, Canadian Council of Archives) on artists’ books, moveable books, machine-woven books, cards, and zines </span></p>

<p>Media histories, including those of paper computing, inform project design and development because they provide us with a sense of how we start in the middle, if you will, of technological reproduction and its material conditions. The past not only shapes the present and future but also demonstrates how novelty (see <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/chunNewMedia.pdf">Chun</a>) is value-laden across the arts, humanities, and sciences. Histories are usually about inventors and innovation, where the new is at once exceptional and prescriptive: a highly regulated sort of rupture. When we witness the allure of “new,” “innovation,” or “inventor” in media history as well as project design, where claims to novelty abound, we might thus inquire about the middle, or what happens before, around, and after the hype of novelty: maintenance, adaptations, hacks, workarounds, wear, tear, rot, and care (see <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/rosnerAmesRepair.pdf">Rosner and Ames</a>).<label for="core" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="core" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/508v4/assets/img/rosner.png" /><br />13.

Although it’s frequently ignored or unattributed, such work cannot be reduced to “service.” It’s critical, requires substantial experience, and is fundamental to knowledge production.</p>

~ Select a primary text (fiction, poetry, manifesto, or even a game) that represents the -ism. You will use this text for prototyping this term, and you’ll need to commit to it by Week 6. Consider working with materials in Special Collections.  <br />
~ Describe (~250 words plus images) your -ism and primary text in your design doc, including not only details about your -ism’s history, politics, and aesthetics (please be as precise as possible and avoid rehearsing information already found in reference materials) but also metadata for your selected text.<label for="metadata" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="metadata" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Metadata</strong>: Following terms from the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/">Dublin Core Metadata Element Set</a>, please provide metadata for ‘coverage’ (the spatial or temporal topic of the resource), ‘creator’ (an entity primarily responsible for making the resource), ‘date’ (a point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource), ‘description’ (an account of the resource), ‘format’ (the file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource), ‘publisher’ (an entity responsible for making the resource available), ‘rights’ (information about rights held in and over the resource), ‘source’ (a related resource from which the described resource is derived), ‘subject’ (the topic of the resource), and ‘title’ (a name given to the resource). </span>  <br />

For instance, content (work) may be written in English and French (expressions), published (manifestation) by a press, and circulated in batches of 5000 copies (each copy = an item). Artists’ books are interesting here because they foreground the status and labour of work as an item. See <a href="https://www.oclc.org/research/activities/frbr.html">FRBR</a>. </span> <br />
~ Discuss Anne Burdick’s design of <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/writing-machines"><em>Writing Machines</em></a> (composed with Katherine Hayles; to be circulated during seminar) and her <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/burdickMeta.pdf">speculative design brief</a> (also circulated during seminar) for <em>Visible Language</em> (30 minutes). <br />

<p>Literary histories are important to project design and development in the humanities because they demonstrate why processes of composition and publication matter for expression, experimentation, representation, and community-building. In short, they show how writing is a form of action. It is not merely interpreted; it does something. And if we treat manifestos, artists’ books, moveable books, and zines as types of “action writing” (see <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/26/bookend/bookend.html">Marcus</a>), which either prompts actions or contains charged design elements, then their links to tabletop games (past and present) become clear.

Prototyping something while also studying its history and composition may be one step in this approach. Understanding it as an entanglement with people and culture (and not just an object to be found, collected, or consumed) may be yet another.</p>

<p>Understanding play is important for design and development because play is a common mode of engagement for many projects.<label for="wells" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="wells" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/508v4/assets/img/wells.jpg" /><br />15.

Public domain.</span> It’s one way to turn input into output, or attention into data. It produces value. In this sense, it’s labour. Consider practices such as crowdsourcing or click farming. Yet play is designed and interpreted variously, from approaches that deem it (perhaps romantically) to be either outside of work or suspended from reality (a “magic circle”), to paradigms that treat it as a lure (see <a href="http://melaniemcbride.net/2008/04/26/creepy-treehouse-v-digital-literacies/">McBride</a> on “creepy treehouses”) for participation and revenue (see <a href="http://bogost.com/writing/blog/gamification_is_bullshit/">Bogost</a> on “gamification” and “exploitationware”) and the entanglement of production with consumption (see <a href="https://www.upne.com/1584655828.html">Beller</a> on the “attention economy” and <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Digital-Labor-The-Internet-as-Playground-and-Factory/Scholz/p/book/9780415896955">Scholz</a> on “playbor”). From a prototyping perspective, people should be able to determine their own definitions of and settings for play. Reducing play to a prescribed or unconscious activity can be a dangerous, or at least presumptuous, gesture. And for many people, play is essential to self-care and community.</p>

<h3 id="week-5-oct-9-change-a-game-">Week 5 (Oct. 9): Change a Game. <a href="#week-5-oct-9-change-a-game-">#</a></h3>

<p>Variability is a staple in histories of paper computing. Games constantly remediate (see <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/remediation">Bolter and Grusin</a>) other games and media, and they are routinely remediated. Creating editions or mashups of games is a popular practice, too (e.g., <em>Scythe</em> becomes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_edZP7hOvU"><em>My Little Scythe</em></a>). This week I’ll ask you to change a tabletop game while reading about variability and versioning in literary and media studies. I hope that changing a game will facilitate the prototyping process (starting <a href="#week-6-oct-16-make-your-text-a-concept-doc-">next week</a>) by rendering it less daunting or opaque.<label for="week5" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="week5" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Keywords and methods for Week 5</strong>: deformance, design charrette, edition, eversion, feature or scope creep, KISS, forensic materiality, formal materiality, mashup, playtesting, provenance, remediation, tiles, versioning<br /><br /><strong>Guest speaker for Week 5</strong>: <a href="http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/">Alexander Galloway</a> (Professor, Media, Culture, and Communication, New York University) on <em>Kriegspiel</em> and the Debord AI </span></p>

<p>This week we’ll transition into prototyping your tabletop games. We’ll talk about the centrality of procedure and procedural literacy to design and development, and I’ll ask you to create a concept doc. As you imagine a prototype, what aspects will be fundamental to the game? What sorts of experiences will the game afford? Or avoid? What frustrations do you have with tabletop games? What do you enjoy or appreciate? How could or should literary and media history inform these decisions? And how are you using prototyping to speculate about the past?<label for="week6" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="week6" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Keywords and methods for Week 6</strong>: alignment, Elito method, end or win conditions, five hat racks, flexibility trade-off, language independence, parallel prototyping, stability (refining), stickiness (SUCCES), storyboarding, swimlanes, volatility (experimentation)<br /><br /><strong>Guest speaker for Week 6</strong>: <a href="http://www.english.umd.edu/featured_profiles/1384">Matthew Kirschenbaum</a> (Associate Professor, English, University of Maryland) on paper computers </span></p>

<p>Please note: during the prototyping half of the term (Week 6 forward), feel free to work individually or in pairs. If you prototype in pairs, then you might need to focus on just one -ism and text for the project. If you have questions or concerns about collaborating in this seminar, then don’t hesitate to touch base with me. We can meet to further discuss possibilities and planning.</p>

<p>Prior to seminar, please: <br />

<p>Procedural literacy is useful for project design and development because it encourages practitioners to think about workflow, sequence, and how people experience rules, steps, levels, mechanics, and the like. It corresponds a bit with scholarship on programming (see <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/coding-literacy">Vee</a> and <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/mateasPL.pdf">Mateas</a>), mediated storytelling and expression (see <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/salterStories.pdf">Salter</a> and <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/wardripfruinEP.pdf">Wardrip-Fruin</a>), and black boxing (see <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674792913">Latour</a>), and it facilitates the articulation of concepts with design and materials. Thinking procedurally does not preclude creativity or experimentation, either. And as demonstrated by scholarship on algorithms (see <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/Virtual-Migration">Aneesh</a>, <a href="http://www.katecrawford.net/docs/CanAnAlgorithmBeAgonistic-April2016.pdf">Crawford</a>,  and <a href="https://nyupress.org/books/9781479837243/">Noble</a>), it’s certainly not free from bias. In the context of tabletop prototyping, procedures can be tested and rehearsed like recipes or scripts. You don’t need to (and probably shouldn’t) produce a polished game before testing its procedures. Here, one challenge is how to prevent procedures from determining player agency or eclipsing experience. Another is how to avoid fetishizing constraints (see <a href="https://www.dalkeyarchive.com/product/oulipo-a-primer-of-potential-literature/">OuLiPo</a>).</p>

<p>The next two weeks are opportunities for you to experiment with themes and mechanics. The ideas in your concept doc will inevitably change during prototyping, and we’ll spend some time testing prototypes and learning more about 2D and 3D design in a tabletop context. How do these design practices shape our interpretations of history? Our conjectures? Our relations with materials in collections and archives?

If you’re starting with mechanics, then consider the core actions or “verbs” that the game and players will perform, and how they align (or not) with your -ism and primary text. In either case, reviewing lists of themes and mechanics may facilitate the process. Also feel free to parallel prototype (experiment with multiple designs at once). Doing so may help you to be more precise about how exactly the dynamics of your tabletop game will bridge aesthetics with mechanics. Where possible, note in your design doc how and why aspects of your concept doc are changing during prototyping. And please bring your prototype(s) to seminar.     <br />
~ Optional: play <em>Azul</em> (abstract, renaissance, tile placement, set collection, pattern building, 2-4 players), <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em> (horror, cooperative modular board, partnerships, 3-6 players), <em>Cosmic Encounter</em> (science fiction, bidding, take-that, simultaneous action selection, variable player powers, 3-5 players), <em>Flamme Rouge</em> (racing, hand management, modular board, simultaneous action selection, 2-4 players), <em>Magic Maze</em> (real-time, cooperative, grid movement, variable player powers, 1-8 players), <em>Onirim</em> (fantasy, cooperative, hand management, set collection, 1 or 2 players), <em>Mint Works</em> (economic, worker placement, card drafting, 1-4 players), <em>Race for the Galaxy</em> (science fiction, hand management, simultaneous action selection, variable player powers, 2-4 players), <em>Sagrada</em> (dice, set collection, pattern building, 1-4 players), or <em>Witness</em> (comics, mystery, cooperative, storytelling, 4 players).</p>

<p>The tensions between themes and mechanics persist across projects, and they are comparable to narratology/ludology debates in academia. Of course, themes and mechanics mutually inform each other, and people’s preferences (and biases) for them vary. Knowing a bit about each can be useful for project design (see <a href="http://www.costik.com/nowords2002.pdf">Costikyan</a>). After all, both are processes entwined with not only ethics (see <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/ethics-computer-games">Sicart</a>) but also the histories of speculation (see <a href="https://adanewmedia.org/2013/11/issue3-haraway/">Haraway</a> and <a href="https://adanewmedia.org/"><em>Ada</em></a>), an aesthetic and political practice which is often dehistoricized for the sake of object-oriented allure (e.g., a “thing” we don’t recognize) or eschatological fantasies (e.g., “end of man” tales).</p>

What are the default settings of most tabletop games? How do conflicts, problems, and partnerships unfold? Who is represented, how, by whom, and under what assumptions? How are mechanics biased, and to what effects on play experiences and play communities? How do games rehearse as well as resist colonialism, capital accumulation, worker exploitation, white supremacy, and cis heteropatriarchy in their themes and mechanics?

<!-- 
* Emergent Asymmetry: Players all start as equal but don’t remain so.  They start with the same number of pieces, the same choices and the same goal.  As the game progresses this will change; one player may have more pieces, for example.  

* Inherent Asymmetry: Players have different goals but the same options.  We all start with the same number of pieces and options but are trying to different things.  For example, one team is trying to score and the other trying to defend.

* Variable Power Asymmetry: Players have different abilities which they pick at the start of the game.  This could be anything from one player being able to take an extra action to preparing your deck before playing a collectible card game.  The challenge here is making sure that the possible choices are all as strong as each other.  You want to avoid one choice being simply better or worse than others.

* “One Big Bad” Asymmetry: One player takes the role of the “big bad” and controls all of the threats the other players will face.  The challenge is that the hero players must all be balanced with each other and the big bad must be balanced against the hero players as a group, no matter how big that group is. -->

<p>Values are a key part of project design and development (see <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/values-play-digital-games">Flanagan and Nissenbaum</a>). If media such as tabletop games are dominated by normative or oppressive values, then how can creative and critical practices change them? Such change involves, but is not limited to, representation (how or whether people see both themselves and history in games), dynamics (the experiences games produce through themes and mechanics), community (how groups form around games), production (who is involved in design and development processes, from ideation to publication), and labour (how and where games are made and circulated, and through what means; also, how people are compensated for their work).

Please log this work in your design doc.<label for="inventories" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="inventories" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Testing inventories</strong>: Some questions that might be useful for this week’s playtesting are, How do the materials imply a logic or sequence? How do they suggest or convey rules and progress? What actions do they trigger? How does their use depend on language? On history? On memory or cultural assumptions? How are players asked to carry materials? How heavy is the game? What’s discarded and where during play? How are the components conducive to silence, politicking, role-playing, or analysis paralysis? How do they correspond with probability? Also try substituting components with other types of components. This exercise may facilitate accessibility. </span><br />
~ Discuss the relationship between inventories, game settings, cultural assumptions, and player experiences (1 hour).<br />
~ Begin planning the end-of-term event (30 minutes).</p>

<p>The components of a project produce and reinforce experiences, and tactile media have interfaces, too (see <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/reading-writing-interfaces">Emerson</a>). Of course materials matter; however, they are often taken for granted as simple byproducts of games (merely tactile manifestations of ideas). At the same time, divisions of labour make it difficult for people to contribute to how projects are designed or manufactured. Familiarity with the entire process is rare, and participating in every step (or seizing the means) can be resource-intensive and exhausting, one reason why many DIY projects struggle to persist. Critical design (see <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/bardzellsCriticalDesign.pdf">Bardzell and Bardzell</a>), including issues of speculation, social responsibility, and accessibility, requires community, and ideally culture (not a tool or gadget) comes first.</p>

<p>Take a break from research, writing, and prototyping. Overwork is toxic, and self-care is important to thriving.</p>

<p>If playing games doesn’t feel like work, then below are some games that have not yet appeared on the schedule. Some are rather involved, tho. Hmmm… so maybe they are work? Your call. I wish you a restful and relaxing break.<label for="duck" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="duck" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/508v4/assets/img/duck.png" /><br />21. ‘Kaninchen und Ente’ (‘Rabbit and Duck’) from the 23 October 1892 issue of <em>Fliegende Blätter</em>. It’s a language-game of aspects according to Ludwig Wittgenstein (<em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, 1953), who made the rabbit-duck famous. Care of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit%E2%80%93duck_illusion#/media/File:Kaninchen_und_Ente.png">Wikimedia</a>. Public domain.</span></p>

<p>Optional: play <em>Agricola</em> (animals, farming, area enclosure, worker placement, 1-5 players), <em>Consulting Detective</em> (mystery, secret agent, cooperative, storytelling, 1-8 players), <em>Dead of Winter</em> (horror, cooperative, action point allowance, storytelling, bluffing, 2-5 players), <em>Dog Eat Dog</em> (“a game of imperialism and assimilation on the Pacific Islands,” at least 3 players), <em>El Grande</em> (renaissance, area influence, bidding, simultaneous action selection, 2-5 players), <em>Fog of Love</em> (bluffing, role-playing, hand management, storytelling, simulation, 2 players), <em>Inis</em> (ancient, area influence, modular board, tile placement, 2-4 players), <em>Isle of Skye</em> (economic, bidding, set collection, tile placement, 2-5 players), <em>Memoir ‘44</em> (wargame, grid movement, area influence, campaign, 2-8 players), <em>Pandemic Legacy</em> (like regular <em>Pandemic</em>, but better), <em>Scythe</em> (science fiction, area influence, variable player powers, 1-5 players), <em>Space Cadets</em> (science fiction, dexterity, real-time cooperative, 3-6 player), <em>Sheriff of Nottingham</em> (bluffing, humour, role-playing, hand management, 3-5 players), <em>Spirit Island</em> (fantasy, cooperative, modular board, variable player powers, 1-4 players), <em>Steam</em> (trains, bidding, network building, tile placement, 3-5 players), <em>Stone Age</em> (prehistoric, set collection, worker placement, 2-4 players), <em>Suburbia</em> (city building, economic, set collection, tile placement, 1-4 players), <em>Terra Mystica</em> (fantasy, economic, area influence, network building, 2-5 players), <em>Terraforming Mars</em> (science fiction, economic, tile placement, set collection, 1-5 players), <em>Troyes</em> (medieval, area influence, dice, worker placement, 2-4 players), or <em>Twilight Imperium</em> (600 minutes, 3-6 players).</p>

<h3 id="week-11-nov-20-fabricate-it-">Week 11 (Nov. 20): Fabricate It. <a href="#week-11-nov-20-fabricate-it-">#</a></h3>

<p>Although you’re not producing a polished game for this course, we’ll spend this week talking about fabrication. How do computer numerical control (CNC) machines, such as laser cutters, routers, and 3D printers, shape our interpretations of history? What are their roles in speculative design, or in conjecturing with and through materials? How are they more than copy machines? We’ll also talk generally about methods for prototyping the past in media and literary studies.<label for="week10" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="week10" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Keywords and methods for Week 11</strong>: CNC, desire lines, fabrication, laser-cutting, love and breakup letters, Ockham’s razor, routing<br /><br /><strong>Guest speaker for Week 11</strong>: <a href="https://www.reneeshelby.com/">Renee M.

* [Grey Lightning](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX4wA5KhEX6o8zZkHnPthUQ), and 
* Board Game Design Lab on [prototypes](http://www.boardgamedesignlab.com/prototypes/)

* outcomes should weighted with probability (less likely, more rewarding, eg)
* interesting games have interesting choices 
* make all available choices appealing 
* make outcomes clear (provide a spectrum, e.g., from 1 always a loss to 20 always a win)
anticipation is linked directly to probability 
have design correspond with probability (skulls for loss, e.g.)
types of probability: 
* binary 
* bonus 
* punishment 
* scale 
* alternatives (gold v iron v silver)
* quantities 

frameworks for probability: 
* power v. vulnerable 
* high v low odds
* big dice v. small 
* many v. few dice
* many v. one attempt

* clever v. casual 
* more v. less options
* more v fewer rules
* strategic advantages v. equal advantages 
* counting v. randomness 

interesting choices involve tradeoffs 

in a dilemma, the outcomes of every choice are bad 

a good dilemma is an epic dilemma:
* don't make it optional 
* make the costs high, but not punishing 
* make it reasonably predictable (make scale and frequency transparent, not random) 

loss aversion: people tend to avoid losing something in order to acquire something else -->

<!-- Manuals help: 

	~ layers of rules: 1) structure, 2) setup, 3) regular play, and 4) exceptions 

* people learn the game from scratch (assume only one person in a group will read them)
* remind the players how to play
* people to look up the weird stuff 

What to make sure your manual has

* The Hook
Get players excited about playing
Include some theme and flavour
Tell the players how they win!  Remember to include the victory condition early

* The Components List
List every component.  Use the name you’re actually using in your game (it’s not a “cube” if it’s supposed to be “barley” in the game.  Call it “barley”)
Include a picture for each component.
List how many of each component there are

* The Setup
Teach players how to set the board up before play
What does each player get?
How many of each thing does each player get?
Include pictures

* What happens each turn
Walk us through what a player does on their turn
How many actions can they take?
What order are the actions in?
Which actions are compulsory? Which actions are optional?

* The weird stuff
What rare situations come up?
What rules conflicts can happen?  

* The end of the game
What happens when the game is over?
How is scoring calculated?
What happens if there’s a tie?

Additional tips:
Use clear language
Use simple language
Use consistent language
Playtest your rules manual -->

<p>During seminar, we will:  <br />
~ Continue playtesting your prototypes. We’ll experiment with shifting balances, clarity of outcomes, and degrees of probability and predictability in your games and also determine what graphics and other components they may need (1 hour). Please log this work in your design doc.      <br />
~ Discuss fabrication methods, their research applications, and their intersections with speculative design and paper computing (30 minutes).<label for="options" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="options" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Automated or manual?</strong> If you’re unsure how to approach the production of your prototype, let’s talk. Some people prefer manual approaches. Then you can photograph the results. But printing and laser-cutting can be more precise, and perhaps friendlier to people who work with software. </span><br />
~ Prep for <a href="#week-12-nov-27-make-it-a-manual-">next week</a> by talking about how to write and test rules for a manual (30 minutes). I’ll bring a variety of examples to peruse.<br />
~ Visit the Library for a workshop on fabrication (1 hour).</p>

<p>There’s a lot of hype around fabrication, especially 3D printing. Learning more about it helps to demystify popular depictions and determine what, if any, applications exist for creative and critical work. Fabrication also prompts people to engage the past with (the limits of) perspective and 2D expression in mind. After all, histories of media are also histories of the senses (see <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/techniques-observer">Crary</a>, <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/listening-in">Douglas</a>, and <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-audible-past">Sterne</a>).</p>

<p>Rules. This week we’ll focus on how to communicate them, test them, clarify them, test them again, refine them, test them once more, and further refine. We’ll look at examples of game manuals (some compelling, some perplexing), and we’ll consider various styles and approaches to their composition. How are they like artists’ books and zines? How are they absolutely not? We’ll also workshop how to write materials for both paper and screen.<label for="week12" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="week12" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Keywords and methods for Week 12</strong>: cognitive walkthrough, efficiency, flow, fly-on-the-wall, inverted pyramid, kibitzing, kingmaking, performance load, personas, rules lawyer, think-aloud protocol, Zeigarnik effect<br /><br /><strong>Guest speaker for Week 12</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/valens116">Nikki Valens</a> (freelance game designer) on designing, writing, and editing <em>Mansions of Madness</em> </span></p>

<p>Prior to seminar, please:<br />
~ Read Jessica Hammer and Meguey Baker, <a href="http://theenemyreader.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Hammer_Baker_The_Enemy.pdf">“Problematizing Power Fantasy”</a> (2014).    <br />
~ Draft your manual, which should include a hook, components list, and descriptions of structure, setup, regular play, exceptions, and end of game. It should also mention minimum age, average play duration, and number of players. Consider a combination of images with text as well as consistent terms and visuals throughout the manual. Feel free to compose the manual by hand, with software, or through a combination of techniques. Please bring your draft manual to seminar. <br />
~ Gather all your prototyping files on your computer and place them in a single folder, which will become a repository for your project.       <br />
~ Refine your prototype if you wish and log the changes in your design doc. Please bring your prototype(s) to seminar.</p>

<p>During seminar, we will:<br />
~ Discuss <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/mansions-of-madness-second-edition/"><em>Mansions of Madness (Second Edition)</em></a> (to be circulated during seminar), including its theme, mechanics, and design across board and app (1 hour).<label for="mansions" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="mansions" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/508v4/assets/img/mansions.jpg" /><br />23. Screengrab of the app for <em>Mansions of Madness (Second Edition)</em>, designed by Nikki Valens. Care of Valens and Fantasy Flight Games. Used with permission.</span>   <br />
~ Playtest your rules (1 hour). This will include tests for cheating or bending the rules as well as exercises where you remove rules. Please log this work in your design doc.     <br />
~ Structure your prototypes as repositorites of files and then review approaches for circulating them online.<label for="online" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="online" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>The Internets</strong>: For storage and circulation, we’ll probably look at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch</a>. </span> We will also discuss how access relates to these approaches (1 hour).      <br />
~ Finalize the details for the end-of-term event.</p>

<p>Manual design is a space where the humanities have much to contribute. Most people begin their tabletop games with manuals, the layout and content of which can be off-putting, confusing, elliptical, repetitive, or dry. But some manuals are quite clever, fun, and even experimental, usually when they demonstrate knowledge of how writing and design are entwined (see <a href="https://www.macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/product/writerdesigner-firstedition-arola">Arola and Ball</a>).</p>

<h3 id="week-13-dec-4-refine-and-package-it-">Week 13 (Dec. 4): Refine and Package It. <a href="#week-13-dec-4-refine-and-package-it-">#</a></h3>

<p>If we have time this week, we’ll discuss various takes on the scales of tabletop gaming, which intersects frequently with the design, collection, and painting of miniatures. Are these worlds escapist? How do they treat time, and how do people experience time in them? What do people want from them, and what are their material histories? Of course, at this point in the term, you’ll probably need a chunk of seminar to refine your prototype. We’ll talk about the refining and publishing process, and we’ll also bind your game manuals with some help from UVic Libraries.<label for="week13" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="week13" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Keywords and methods for Week 13</strong>: elaborative rehearsal, Kano analysis,  maintenance rehearsal<br /><br /><strong>Guest speakers for Week 13</strong>: <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/about/">Emily Care Boss</a> (Black and Green Games) on designing, developing, and publishing games; and also <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/library/research/librarians/mlines/index.php">Michael Lines</a> (Learning and Research Librarian, UVic) on bookbinding </span></p>

<p>Prior to seminar, please:  <br />
~ Read Susan Stewart, <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/stewartOnLonging.pdf">“The Miniature”</a> (from <em>On Longing: Narratives of the Miniature, the Gigantic, the Souvenir, the Collection</em>, 1993); and Louise Krasniewicz, <a href="https://thewonderofminiatures.com/2015/05/20/miniature-manifesto-part-1-call-us-makers/">“Miniature Manifesto”</a> (2015). <br />
~ Refine and polish your prototype, including the manual. Document the changes. Please bring your (final?) prototype to seminar, together with at least two print copies of your (final?) manual.</p>

<p>Something’s due: Your design doc is due this week for assessment.</p>

<p>During seminar, we will:  <br />
~ Discuss <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/">Black and Green Games</a> (materials to be circulated during seminar), including their approach to publishing and design (1 hour).<label for="romance" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="romance" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/508v4/assets/img/romance.jpg" /><br />24. <em>Romance Trilogy</em>, three quick games about the human heart, by Emily Care Boss. Care of <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/">Black and Green Games</a>. Used with permission.</span>         <br />
~ Playtest your prototypes one more time, with an emphasis on lingering issues and concerns as well as packaging (30 minutes). Please log this work in your design doc.   <br />
~ Bind your manuals during a bookbinding workshop (1 hour).<label for="binding" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="binding" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><strong>Bookbinding</strong>: You’ll have the option to bind your manual with quality paper covers. I’ll provide you with some paper types to select, and Michael Lines will supply needles and thread for the day. He’s suggested a pamphlet binding with options for pockets in the covers, or wrap-around closures. </span>   <br />
~ Review what we’ve done and learned and then complete course experience surveys (30 minutes).</p>

<p>A lot of labour goes into prototyping a project. And for the purposes of research and experimentation, prototypes may stand on their own. (To be candid, this is my preference and approach.) Yet there’s even more to do once prototyping is done. Development, testing, production, binding, packaging, rights management, licensing, publication, distribution, expansion, and archiving are demanding and complex processes, hence the tendency for gaming and other media practices to be both collaborative and distributed in character.</p>

Public domain.</span> This week (exact date and time to be determined, and subject to group approval), you’ll present your prototype and ask people to play it. After that, I’ll give you some time to revise your presentation into a short paper, which you can submit with your prototype.</p>

<p>During the end-of-term event, please: <br />
~ Present your prototype, its relation to your -ism and primary text, and its relevance to literary and media studies (5-7 minutes). Don’t forget to also engage how exactly your prototype speculates about the past.   <br />
~ Invite people to play the prototype, which should be accompanied by your manual (packaging optional).   <br />
~ Observe and, if you wish, document (with permission) how people play your prototype.</p>

<p>I’ll return feedback on, as well as marks for, seminar participation and your design docs before the end-of-term event. After the event, I’ll also provide you with feedback on your prototype and talk before they’re due for assessment.</p>

<p>After the event (no later than December 18th at noon), please: <br />
~ Submit your prototype as a tactile thing and repository of files. The prototype should include your manual and all game components.   <br />
~ Email me your talk in polished form (as a paper of 1500-2000 words, plus figures, notes, and works cited in MLA format).</p>
