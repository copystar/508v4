## Paper Computing

* May be a synonym for tabletop gaming (see Kirschenbaum)
* Stresses paper as a medium for storage, processing, and use 
* Highlights computing as embodied labour (neither abstract nor fully automated)
* Further notes how this labour is often ignored in histories of science, technology, media, art, and literature
* Underscores how paper (like screens) prompts input (see Gitelman on blanks)
* Foregrounds design (graphic, interaction, experience) and how paper may structure or facilitate certain forms of perception (see Miles on the tabular view)
* Likely involves quantification or procedural thinking 
* Raises questions about how forms such as artists' books, manifestos, and zines (as experiments with paper, if you will) are entwined with gaming and tabletop gaming in particular 

## Game Speak

* **algorithm**: a procedure or formula for conducting a specific action; performed by people and materials in tabletop games; usually black-boxed in videogames
* **components**: tactile parts or bits of a game
* **dynamics**: embodied patterns of play
* **family**: the genre of the game 
* **game space**: the area of the game
* **game state**: all the information or variables at play in a given gaming scenario; may include everything from number of players and components to possible actions and conflicts to goals and win conditions; essentially the game's "metagame" (see Romero and Schreiber)
* **game view**: the info or variables a given player can see (compare with game state) (see Romero and Schreiber) 
* **mechanic or mechanism**: an action or function that can be performed in a game (compare with rule)
* **rules**: guidelines or protocols for action; communicated in the manual or rulebook (compare with mechanic)
* **theme**: the subject matter (story, setting, characters, and even design) of the game 

## Design Speak

* **action writing**: coming soon (see Steven Marcus)
* **A-D-M**: a player-centric approach to game design; aesthetics (A) are observed in dynamics (D) that are linked to mechanics (M); aesthetics may include sensation, fantasy, narrative, challenge, social interaction, discovery, expression, and ritual (see Hunicke, LeBlanc, and Zubek)
* **aleatory procedures**: the use of chance or randomness in design; often intended to reduce a sense of control; also a critique of romantic genius 
* **alternative uses task**: ask people to list as many possible uses for a common household item; assessed on originality, fluency, flexibility, and elaboration (see Guilford via Kari Kraus)
* **artifact analysis**: study a given text's *materials* (composition, components, durability, wear, disposibility), *aesthetics* (form, color, texture, references, emotional significance), *affordances* (operational uses, functions, complexity), *context* (where it's stored and carried, whether part of a larger whole, time and space, ownership, public, private), and *potential* for misuse and repurposing (see Martin and Hanington)
* **artist's book**: interrogates the material and conceptual form of the book; not reducible to the vision of an editor; refrains from standardized or mechanical repetition; imaginative use of methods and means of production, including but not limited to fine printing; may involve indie printing or publishing; expresses independent or activist thought; implies an informed viewer; not a democratic multiple (see Johanna Drucker)
* **blanks**: they are printed and used, not authored or read; they connect the intimacy of material objects and collections with the abstractions of bureaucracy, forms, and social structures; also prompt input from readers (see Lisa Gitelman)
* **context of use**: a way to consider actual situations and practices of use (as opposed to ideal forms or intended uses) (see Andrea Botero)
* **design as inquiry**: treating design as a mode or line of research, as opposed to rendering it to be a quality of an object or a property inherent to an object (see Daniela Rosner)
* **design fiction**: the use of prototype objects that tell stories about possible near futures (see Julian Bleecker)
* **diegetic action**: action that contributes to the theme or narrative development of a game (see Alexander Galloway) 
* **interface**: coming soon (see Lori Emerson)
* **M-D-A**: a designer-centric approach to game design; mechanics (M) enable certain dynamics (D) that foster particular experiences and aesthetics (A) (see Hunicke, LeBlanc, and Zubek)
* **machine-woven book**: coming soon 
* **machines**: a system of mechanisms that shape actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement; a popular term during the 19th c. 
* **manifesto**: public declarations (and often loud ones at that) (Mary Ann Caws 2001: xix), announcements of motives for forthcoming action (xix), acts of deliberate manipulation (both aesthetic and political) (xix), rooted in the hand (manus) or handmade (xix), directives (usually against something) articulated by a specific "we" (xxi), serious, and frequently without irony (xxi), situated in time, typically with an investment in being first (xxiii), instructive or pedagogical (xxiii), arranged or, indeed, designed (xxiii), efforts to label or categorize (even if loosely) (xxiv), duck, not decoration (xxv), written in the present tense (now!) (xxvi), advertisements (they sell themselves) (xxv), and subject to redefinition and recontextualization over time (xxviii-xxix)
* **moveable book**: another term for a pop-up book or a book with moving (paper) parts  
* **near futures**: thinking and designing in terms of possible tomorrows (as opposed to distant futures) (see Julian Bleecker)
* **nondiegetic action**: action that does not contribute to the theme or narrative development of a game (see Alexander Galloway) 
* **participatory research and design**: cyclical, collaborative processes that intend to change members of the inquiry; involves numerous groups (not just designers) in the design process (see Martin and Hanington)
* **prediction**: "the use of statistical models, simulations, and testable hypotheses to forecast future events" (see Kari Kraus)
* **protocol**: coming soon 
* **restoration**: "a means to re-establish [a cultural object] in a completed state, which may in fact never have actually existed at any given time;" involves speculation in the process (see Eug√®ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc via Kari Kraus)
* **scenario prototyping**: active participation in design through subjective engagement with a prototype; a narrative exploring past or future uses of a design/product from a user's point of view (see Martin and Hanington)
* **simulation exercises**: deep approximations of human or environmental conditions, with an emphasis on empathy and functional interaction (see Martin and Hanington)
* **speculative design**: favours inquiry, experimentation, and expression over usability and marketability; calls attention to the possibilities and consequences of technological development and implementation; treats futures as media for imaginative thought; asks what is possible, plausible, probable, and preferable (see Carl DiSalvo and Jonathan Lukens; Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby; and Stuart Candy)
* **Wizard of Oz**: participants are led to believe they are interacting with a working prototype, but in reality a researcher is acting as a proxy from behind the scenes; experience is realistic but the prototype isn't functioning (see Martin and Hanington)
* **zine**: coming soon (see Janice Radway)

## Theory Speak

* **affect**: unqualified or pre-personal intensity; not feelings (because it isn't labeled); not emotions (because it isn't projected); important in studies of play (see Brian Massumi and Eric Shouse)
* **conjectural criticism**: "the recovery of lost readings in classical texts, and the computational modeling of the evolution of a literary work or the descent of a natural language;" it is "concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction" (see Kari Kraus)
* **forensic imagination**: creative and critical work involving deep attention to the material particulars or intricate details of media; often includes an interest in storage, inscription, and instrumentation; think Blake seeing a world in a grain of sand (see Matthew Kirschenbaum)
* **ludology**: coming soon 
* **media archaeology**: "a methodological preference for rejecting the projection of generalized theories in favor of precise case studies, that is, for embedded theory;" "this method aims to avoid prematurely interpreting archival or archaeological evidence as documents of history but rather isolates this data into discrete series in order to rearrange them and open them for different configurations. The mechanism of human memory is selective, transformative, and thus productive of historical imagination, whereas the general inventory of photography [for example] in accordance with media logic registers temporal events without demanding a binding historical narrative;" "media archaeology is on the side of the indexical and the archival mode of writing" (see Wolfgang Ernst via  Jussi Parikka)
* **memory**: the process of compiling or re-membering this into that; contingent on materials and embodiment; necessarily relational and arguably always interpretive; prompts questions about what people wish to forget or not remember (compare with storage) (see Wendy Chun)
* **narratology**: coming soon 
* **ontological theatre**: the use of scenarios, media, or performance to inspire people to make something similar to what's presented; used to prompt engagement instead of re-presentation (see Andrew Pickering) 
* **procedural experiments**: the use of algorithmic or "uncreative" methods to produce unexpected and illuminative results (see Bethany Nowviskie and OuLiPo)
* **speculative fiction**: an umbrella term for science fiction, fantasy, futurisms, dystopias, utopias, horror, and the supernatural 
* **storage**: the inscription or housing of records and files; emphasis often on discrete units and keeping things found; central to GLAM work (compare with memory)
* **subjunctive knowledge**: "knowledge about what might have been or could be or almost was" (see Kari Kraus)
* **work-expression-manifestation-item**: works are realized through one or more expressions, which are embodied as manifestations, which are exemplified as items; for instance, content (work) may be written in English and French (expressions), published (manifestation) by a press, and circulated in batches of 5000 copies (each copy = an item) (see FRBR) 

## Tech Speak

* **bit box**: a collection of components for playing and/or designing tabletop games 
* **Dublin Core**: a small set of metadata vocabulary terms that can be used to describe digital resources as well as physical resources; often used to link resources together ("semantic web")
* **metadata**: coming soon (see Bowker and Star) 
* **Markdown**: a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax; designed to be converted into other formats, such as HTML; extension/suffix is MD (but TXT also works)
* **Tabletop Simulator**: allows people to play and create tabletop games in a multiplayer physics sandbox; created with the Unity engine 
* **text editor**: a piece of software for editing "plain text" as character representations; seen as an alternative to what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) word processors and rich text; often entwined with rhetorics of command line or coding knowledge as well as distraction-free composition 

## Prototyping 

Types of prototypes relevant to this seminar and overlapping with media history, literary history, and textual criticism: 
* **imitation** (labour of the text): to better understand the composition of a text by learning the techniques involved in its production
* **forgery** (economy of the text): to better understand the public perception and/or value of a text by learning the techniques involved in its production, but with intent to either deceive or reveal deception
* **scenario** (interaction with the text): to better understand how people may ultimately interpret a text by situating it in contexts of use and then observing those uses
* **story** (performance of the text): to better understand how a text gains cultural traction or builds identity by treating it as a script and performing it on or off record
* **counterfactual** (norms or conditions of the text): to better understand the biases of a text (or common interpretations of it) by constructing "what-if" alternatives to specific aspects of its history, content, or composition (see Bonsignore et al.)
* **model** (logic or conventions of the text): to better understand the mode, form, genre, scale, or design of a text by rendering it as an abstraction, using it to alter other texts (or aspects of itself), and determining why the changes are interesting (if at all)
* **glitch** (negotiations with the text): to better understand hiccups or surprises in a text by isolating them, applying them procedurally or randomly to other texts (or aspects of itself), and determining why the changes are interesting (if at all)
* **wish** (ideology of the text): to better understand the worldviews, belief systems, or desires of a text by increasing/decreasing their frequency, reversing them, or otherwise manipulating them and then determining why the changes are interesting (if at all)

Speculating about history through prototyping (this adapts work by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby as well as Stuart Candy to think about the past and not just futures in speculative design): 
* **Probable**: history that likely happened (something like the "attested state" of literary or cultural history upon which most scholarship is built)
* **Plausible**: history that could have happened (something like an "alternative state" of literary or cultural history that most scholars would entertain as likely or persuasive)
* **Possible**: history that potentially happened, or for which there is potential (something like a "relatable" or "suggested state" of literary or cultural history that most scholars could imagine)
* **Preferable**: history we (whoever "we" are) want to see in the world (something like a "projected" or "necessary state" of literary or cultural history that may be ignored, discounted, counterfactual, or fictional)

Prototyping may be considered a form of textual criticism that: 
* Performs a method or physically *manifests a way of reading* through techniques such as imitation, alteration, scripting, repetition, simulation, recontextualization, modelling, counterfactuals, ruination, and trial-and-error testing, to name a few.
* Is interpreted or assessed based on its effectiveness as *an experiment*, or how persuasively it changes or isolates the systems through which texts and contexts afford meaning. Such systems may include matters of perception (e.g., how texts are seen or engaged), semantics (e.g., how signifiers relate and produce meaning), aesthetics (e.g., how texts are arranged and composed), politics (e.g., how texts enable or are embedded in ideologies), history (e.g., how texts are anchored in time and space but also move across them), materials (e.g., the stuff of which texts are made), and want or need (e.g., wishes, desires, uses, and applications).
* Expresses *a form or model*, which foregrounds use and prompts specific actions. Such actions may include writing in a margin or blank space, entering data, replying to a message, fixing a bug, following steps, signing, clicking, copying, pasting, deleting, scanning, redacting, searching, tagging, spamming, non-communication (e.g., in the case of frustration, silence, or confusion), or simply listening, watching, or reading. The consequences of these actions are not always predictable. In fact, the most persuasive prototypes *foster surprise*.
* Articulates *language and meaning with matter*. While prototypes are conceptual, they demonstrate (as opposed to re-present) how concepts work through materials and settings.
* Suggests or conjectures something instead of proving it. That is, it's a *situation for interpretation*, not a standalone object. Meaning is an effect of experimentation, not an ingredient of it.
* Offers *an imaginary scenario or solution* to examine the results. Such solutions may include improving features of a text, stewarding it into the present, remediating it, remaking it, repairing it, or‚Äîto demonstrate why it was persuasive in the first place‚Äîruining it. Any of these practices may experiment with alternate histories, probable futures, adjacent possibilities, or absences in the archive.
* Often uses *ephemerality as a medium*. That is, it tends to be more interested in what escapes than what persists. Here, we may consider how interactions, interfaces, performances, rhythms, impressions, feelings, and affects escape the record or are difficult to "capture" with technologies. Put this way, loss is not an anxiety or emphasis. Change becomes the most interesting or suggestive element of creativity and criticism.

Prototyping asks how texts address us like (or as) images (see WJT Mitchell). That is, how: 
* Texts function as *public documents*, intended for passersby. Here, negative space, lines, typefaces, and font sizes are especially important (e.g., graphic design). As image, the **text wants your attention**. It is charged. It is read from a distance.
* Texts become *symbols*, intended for extended observation. Here, the form or "face" across characters is key (e.g., topography). As image, the **text wants to escape reality**. It welds feeling with arrangement, against the reduction of signs to mere vehicles for meaning.
* Texts manifest *ways of reading*, intended for familiarization or defamiliarization. Here, orientation, embodiment, and eye movement are most significant (e.g., interface design). As image, the **text wants to afford certain readings**. It influences or even structures vision.
* Texts create *relations* with other texts, intended for the production or analysis of patterns. Here, juxtaposition and reference are central (e.g., interaction design). As image, the **text wants to be an index**, with readers traversing across (or toggling between) it and something else. It connects.
* Texts are *proof*, intended as evidence. Here, the truth claims of a text are emphasized (e.g., forensics). As image, the **text wants to be a record**. It is like a photograph or signature. It points or demonstrates.
* Texts are *objects or commodities*, intended for collection and exhibition. Here, the value, availability, and economy of texts are privileged (e.g., book arts). As image, the **text wants to be displayed**. People travel to witness the original. Something about it cannot be copied.
* Texts are *scans*, intended primarily for access on screen. Here, recognition, formats, and relations between witnesses, editions, originals, and copies are the focus (e.g., versioning). As image, the **text wants to be found or archived**. It is its legibility.
* Texts are *edges*, intended to produce boundaries. Here, page size, margins, and paper matter (e.g., layout design). As image, the **text wants to frame language and reading**. It demarcates.
* Texts are *windows or portals*, intended for transparency. Here, clarity is everything (e.g., instrumental design). As image, the **text gives people want they want or expect**. It is a vehicle for exchange.
* Texts are *mirrors*, intended for reflection or re-presentation. Here, a lack of ornament, a use of familiar features, and an insistence on accuracy of perspective are significant (e.g., isomorphic design). As image, the **text wants to express the world precisely and/or prompt awareness** (or social- or self-awareness). It hails.
* Texts are *tactile*, intended for handling and touching. Here, texture is paramount (e.g., materials design). As image, the **text wants to be tangible**, or it does not want to be behind glass or screen. It exposes the limits of vision and ocularcentrism.
* Texts are *processes*, intended to resist alienation or abstraction. Here, composition, traces of interaction, gradual change, and the time spent making, reproducing, preserving, and disposing are most important (e.g., labour studies). As image, the **text wants to be a verb**. It is mutable. It decays, rots, morphs, grows. It is also tied to various "invisible" contributors and acts of production.
* Texts are *dogma*, intended for followers. Here, lists, point form, and order are foregrounded (e.g., litany). As image, the **text wants to be copied, distributed, consulted, and observed**. It directs or guides.
* Texts are *policy or law*, intended for nations, citizens, or employees. Here, an absence of aesthetics, a lack of variation, or an assertion of consistency is crucial (e.g., protocol). The **text does not want to be an image. It wants to be code or procedure**, with a standard. It is executable.
